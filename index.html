    <p><strong>Hi! My name is Virginia,</strong> I'm a 23 yo Italian student at TU Delft in the Netherlands. Currently, I study at the master <i>Design for Interaction</i> and I work as illustrator and photographer. I'm interested in product and service design with a focus on social challenges and in the future I would like to work in the improvement of public transportations. I'm really passionate about art and photography, if you want to see the pictures I take for fun you can check my Instagram. </p>
